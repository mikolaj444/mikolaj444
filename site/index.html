            <p>hello! my name is nick, i am 19 and my hobbies are art, playing games, and reading. <br>
                my favourite books are "it's kind of a funny story" by ned vizzini and "impulse" by ellen hopkins as well as a handful of others but these are my two number ones. <br>
                i like traditional art, but i prefer digital art. it gives a lot more freedom with what you can do or make.</p>
            <p>i like watching movies, my favourite movies being my suicide and the saw franchise, as well as donnie darko, brother bear, the 2022 batman, se7en, and holes!<br>
                speaking of watching things, i also really like breaking bad, shameless, avatar the last airbender, voltron legendary defenders (shameful to admit i know), and popee the performer.</p>
            <p>my current favourite games are Stray and Wizard101.</p>
